## Possible next improvements

1. **Input Validation**: Add input validation to ensure that the user provides valid latitude, longitude, and distance values.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to handle cases where the optimization algorithm fails to converge or the input data is insufficient.

3. **Optimization Algorithm**: Consider using a different optimization algorithm or fine-tuning the parameters of the existing one to potentially improve convergence and accuracy.

4. **Modularization**: Break down the code into smaller, reusable functions for better maintainability and readability.

5. **Documentation**: Include inline comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.

6. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the code and ensure that future changes don't introduce regressions.
